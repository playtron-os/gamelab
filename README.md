# Playtron Labs

Playtron Labs is part of the Playtron ecosystem and lets users configure games to get the best experience possible.
Custom game configurations can then be shared with and benefit the whole Playtron community.

## Installing Playtron Labs

Packages for all major systems are available on our Github release page

https://github.com/playtron-os/playtron-labs/releases/

We provide installers for Linux, Mac and Windows in different formats. Download and install the appropriate package for your platform.

## Setup

Before you can use Labs, you'll need a device running Playtron OS.
Make sure your Playtron device authorizes remote access and note its IP address.

Then open the Labs application on your computer. You should see a greeting screen asking you
to connect to a device. Enter the IP address of the Playtron device and click Connect.

## Usage

Once connected to a Playtron device, you'll have access to your game library where you can install and run games.
Labs also lets you create and select custom launch and input configurations.

# Development

## Technologies

All technologies used are listed in the Dependencies.MD file, here are the most important ones used by this project:

- Tauri - https://tauri.app/
- Vite - https://vitejs.dev/
- ReactJS - https://react.dev/
- Lingui - https://lingui.dev
- Typescript - https://www.typescriptlang.org/

## Setup

The app has two processes, the UI which is compiled and served using vite, and the main process that communicates with the OS native layer to launch the app using the Tauri rust backend.
UI: `./src`
Backend: `./src-tauri`

#### Dev dependencies

To compile this tauri app on Fedora you'll need to install the following packages:

```
sudo dnf check-update
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel \
openssl-devel \
curl \
wget \
file \
libappindicator-gtk3-devel \
librsvg2-devel
sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries"
```

See [the Tauri documentation](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#linux) if youâ€™re not using Fedora.

Install the NPM dependencies as well:

`pnpm install`

### Run the app

To start Labs from the development environment, run:

`pnpm start`

### Conventions and guidelines for contributors

Please read the [guidelines](./Guidelines.MD) document when contributing to the project.

### Translations

This project has lingui setup for translations.
With lingui we can use the `t` or `Trans` macros from `@lingui/macro` to generate translation keys on the go, without having to manually define a translation file.

#### Adding new text

When adding text to the app please wrap it in one of these macros to make it ready for i18n:

##### With `t`:

```
import { t } from "@lingui/macro";

export default function TestComponent() {
  return <div>{t`My internationalized text`}</div>;
}
```

The `t` macro can also be used outside React components.

With `Trans`:

```
import { Trans } from "@lingui/macro"
export default function TestComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Trans>`My internationalized text`</Trans>
    </div>;
  );
}

```

After that you can run `pnpm translations:extract` to automatically generate translations keys for all locales (this will be added to the locale messages.po file). The generated .po file is ready for translators to work with, being supported by most translation tools used by translations.
The .po files are automatically compiled by vite during the build, and are loaded dynamically: see https://lingui.dev/guides/dynamic-loading-catalogs

With the basic information above you should already be able to use this i18n library, more information can be found here: [Lingui React Patterns](https://lingui.dev/tutorials/react-patterns).

## Releases

The pipeline in this repo will automatically build and upload the installers to the github releases once code is merged to the `release` branch.
To change the version of the release, please update `package.json`

## Available Scripts
